# Hi :sparkles:

This is where I store what I compose with Tidal. I use a lot of custom samples, synths and functions, so expect some tinkering to get any of these to play. It may help to check my [tidalcycles scripts repo](https://github.com/ghalestrilo/libtidal). You're welcome to read up on these pieces on my [homepage](https://ghales.com/art) as well
